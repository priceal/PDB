the first goal will be to create scripts that do...

1. given a list of PDB files, download the files and create local DB
2. generate fasta files of all protein and DNA sequences



protein length 100-200 residues
DNA
  Structure-level Features
 Number of DNA Entities:
min 1
max 2

  DNA Entity-level Features
 Number of Strands:
min 2
max 2
 Number of Helices:
min 1
max 1
result: 344 pdb codes (initialCodes.csv)
